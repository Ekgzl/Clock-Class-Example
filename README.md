# Clock Class Example

This simple C++ program defines a class called `clockType`. This class is used to represent a clock and holds the time in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds. Additionally, it provides a method `incrementSeconds()` to increase the time by one second.

## How to Use

Firstly, an object of the `clockType` class is created, and the time is set using the `setTime()` method specifying the hours, minutes, and seconds. Then, the `incrementSeconds()` function is called to increase the time by one second, and finally, the new time is printed using the `printTime()` method.
